# create-pipe
Simple project to create fasty linux pipes with NodeJS.

## How to use

Create the pipe
```
npx create-pipe [name]

// or 

yarn create pipe [name]
```
Now, go to `[name]/pipe.js` and code your pipe with javascript.

At finish, `npm install -g` to test locally or `npm run build` to generate binaries. They will be in `dist/` 

*Personal tip: I usually create a ~/bin folder and add it to PATH in order to save all binaries*
